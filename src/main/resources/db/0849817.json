  "description" : "He went off to war an unknown soldier, and returned a beloved hero. Often dismissed as a good-natured bumbler, he was actually a skillful politician, a tough Cold Warrior, and one of America's leas understood presidents. IKE: The American Experience presents a fresh look at Dwight D. Eisenhower, incorporating recently declassified information, extensive archival footage of World War II and the 1950s, hundreds of still photographs, excerpts from Eisenower's correspondence and diaries, and interviews with hostorians, eyewitnesses, and members of the Eisenhower family. From his childhood years in Kansas, through his meteoric rise during World War II to become the symbol of the Allied victory over the Nazis, IKE traces Eisenhower's rise to the White House, where his two terms were marked by turbulent anti-communism, an increasingly dangerous Cold War and the beginning of school integration. When he left office in 1960, historians ranked Eisenhower in the bottom third of American presidents. By the 1990s, he ranked near the top.",
