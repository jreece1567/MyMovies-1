  "description" : "Early Christianity faced powerful obstacles. The might of the Roman Empire and the power-politics of ancient Jerusalem laid a heavy burden on those who believed Jesus was the Messiah. But this new faith would not die. In a brief span of time, the fledgling religion would transcend its origins in the provinces of Rome and absorb the capital of the empire itself.",
