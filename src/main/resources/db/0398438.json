  "description" : "Churchill, a three-part series, explores many of the myths that surround the Churchill legend. Episode 1, Destiny, tells the story of Churchill's early life - his aristocratic birth, his search for glory on the battlefield, his rise up the political ladder and his fall from it. Episode 2, The Lion?s Roar, traces Churchill's leadership of Britain through its finest hour during the Battle of Britain to its darkest hour in 1942. Episode 3, The Last Prize, opens with Churchill's day trip to the Normandy beaches in June 1944. It goes on to examine Churchill's second term as Prime Minister and his public and private struggles until his death in January 1965.",
