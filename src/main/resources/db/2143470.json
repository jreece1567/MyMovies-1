  "description" : "Beacon Theatre Live from New York rips through 20 songs spanning Bonamassa s career with smoky vocals complementing the guitar wizardry and rapid-fingered ease with which his fans know and love. Alongside the great chemistry he shares with his formidable bandmates Carmine Rojas (bass), Tal Bergman (drums) and Rick Melick (keyboards), the performance is mesmerizing to watch. He kicks it off with Slow Train, from 2011's solo album Dust Bowl and rolls through a number of fan-favorites including: Cradle Song, Dust Bowl, When The Fire Hits The Sea, Bird On A Wire, Blue & Evil, Mountain Time, and many more.",
