  "description" : "&quot;Live In Tokyo&quot; was filmed at the Tokyo Dome City Hall in Japan on April 9th 2014. These Japanese dates were the first to feature Jeff Beck&apos;s new backing band of Jonathan Joseph (drums), Nicolas Meier (guitars) and Rhonda Smith (bass) and the setlist includes some material from his new, as yet unreleased, studio album. In contrast to Beck's previous visual releases, both filmed in small clubs, Live In Tokyo is filmed in a major concert arena and has a very different, more expansive feel. Jeff Beck is a true guitar legend and this show captures him at his very best",
