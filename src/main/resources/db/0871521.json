  "description" : "At the end of 1853, San Francisco was a city on the fast track. A few years earlier, the seaside town had been a sleepy village of just 800 people. But the sight of gold in the waters of the American River set the stage for an event that would forever change a city, a fledgling state, and the nation. Incorporating rare and exquisite daguerreotypes and original recreations, this film offers a vivid portrait of a seminal event in America's history.",
