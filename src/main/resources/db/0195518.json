  "description" : "Complex social and political factors shaped America's response to the Holocaust, from 'Kristallnacht' in 1938 through the liberation of the death camps in 1945. For a short time, the US had an opportunity to open its doors, but instead erected a 'paper wall', a bureaucratic maze that prevented all but a few Jewish refugees from entering the country. It was not until 1944, that a small band of Treasury Department employees forced the government to respond.",
