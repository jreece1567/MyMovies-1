The Donner Party's nightmarish journey penetrated to the very heart of the American Dream at a crucial phase of the nation's 'manifest destiny'. Touching some of the most powerful social, economic and political currents of the time, this extraordinary narrative remains one of the most compelling and enduring episodes to come out of the West.",
