  "description" : "This episode from the Secrets of Ancient Empires collection investigates the very latest findings about the development of the earliest civilizations. Superb graphics and re-creations combine to reveal the truth behind our transition from hunter gatherer to city dweller as the myth of the 'primitive savages' of pre-history is explored. The great ancient cities of Babylon and Jericho are explored as the program compares the lives of our earliest ancestors and their nomadic contemporaries.",
