  "description" : "Tennessee biology teacher John Scopes was arrested in 1925 for teaching evolution in defiance of state law. His trial became an epic free speech debate that spiraled into an all-out duel between science and religion, with two of the century's greatest orators, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan, as competing attorneys. MONKEY TRIAL explores the social fault line between scientific discoveries and the literal truth of the Bible.",
