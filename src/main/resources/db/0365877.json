  "description" : "Ulysses S. Grant was an American paradox. A failed businessman, he became a brilliant military strategist whose destruction of a defiant South gained him the label 'butcher'. Elected president in 1868, Grant lacked the skill to deal with reconstruction and the nation's economy. His two terms were rocked by racial conflict and corruption scandals. Financially ruined, Grant spent his final days battling cancer to finish his war memoirs.",
