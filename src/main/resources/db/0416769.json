  "description" : "This is the sweeping epic story of the Battle of Gettysburg as experienced by the soldiers who were there. In mid-July 1863, Union Lieutenant Frank A. Haskell wrote a letter to his brother which is considered one of the most vivid and well-written accounts of the battle of Gettysburg. Haskell's compelling words and moving eyewitness accounts from soldiers on both sides serve as our window to the largest battle ever fought on American soil.",
