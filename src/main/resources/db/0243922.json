  "description" : "The story of a man who grew into greatness by accepting the challenge of leading a fractious, rag-tag army against the might of the British government. As a young man, Washington was a social climber, a land-hungry Virginia surveyor and self-conscious military officer, often blaming others for his own mistakes. However, he gradually built a reputation as a gentleman by educating himself in the classics and sciences, entering politics, and marrying one of the wealthiest women in Virginia. It was at the battle of Trenton where everything changed. Brilliantly timing his attack on Christmas night, Trenton was a psychological victory both for America and for Washington himself. His growing skill and unwavering bravery transformed Washington into the very symbol of the Revolutionary War.",
