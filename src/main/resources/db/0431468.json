  "description" : "This provocative but balanced documentary begins by providing the historical context necessary to understand President Bush's evangelical agenda - exploring the five-decade political education of conservative Christians. Then it zeroes in on Bush himself with a religious biography - from his mid-life crisis involving excessive drinking and a failing business, to his pivotal meeting with a cross-carrying evangelist, and finally to the skillful embrace of 'born-again' imagery that helped elect him president.",
