  "description" : "In May of 2004, Beth Hart returned to Amsterdam for a triumphant SRO performance at the Paradiso, one of the city's most beautiful concert halls. Having just come off her 2003 European Tour, Beth and her band were ready to shake things up and did not disappoint. Live at Paradiso is a bone-chilling concert film that faithfully captures the magic of that very evening.",
