  "description" : "Her name is synonymous with the French monarchy and all its excesses, but there is more to the story of Marie Antoinette than the simple tale of how a frivolous sovereign helped provoke the uprising that became the French Revolution. Acclaimed documentary filmmaker David Grubin paints a surprising portrait of a courageous figure and traces her journey from the splendors of a childhood in the mighty Austro-Hungarian Empire to a French guillotine.",
