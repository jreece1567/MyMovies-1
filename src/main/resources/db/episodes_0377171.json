  "description" : "Einstein's dream was to find a Theory of Everything that unites general relativity (the world of the large, involving the force of gravity) and quantum mechanics (the world of the small, involving the forces of strong nuclear force, electromagnetism, and weak nuclear force). Re-tracing the history of string theory, which posits that the smallest particle is a string that vibrates at a specific frequency. String theory predicts six extra dimensions, whose function may be to define the numerical constants in nature."
