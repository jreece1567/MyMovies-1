  "description" : "While Europe languished in the Dark Ages, thinkers in China, India, and the Islamic world pushed mathematical frontiers. Besides giving us the concepts of zero and infinity, they translated geometry into numbers (and back) with trigonometry and provided a mathematical grammar with algebra."

  "description" : "Can mathematics precisely describe a body in motion? To answer that question, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz independently devised calculus in the 17th century. Over the following 200 years, however, mathematicians began to rethink Euclidian concepts, conceiving of new geometries to describe unseen dimensions."
